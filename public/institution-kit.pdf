# Institution Kit - FAIRy v0.1

## Overview

FAIRy is a local-first validator and packager for research datasets, designed to reduce deposit back-and-forth across your campus. This kit provides everything you need to evaluate and deploy FAIRy in your institution.

## Key Benefits

- **Reduce curator workload**: Clear validation reports with "how to fix" guidance
- **Local-first privacy**: No data leaves your network
- **Batch processing**: CLI pipelines for hundreds of datasets
- **Repository compliance**: GEO/Zenodo-specific checks with guideline links

## Security Summary

### Local-First Architecture
- All processing happens on-device
- No telemetry by default (opt-in via environment variable)
- No credentials stored
- Offline install instructions available

### Network Access
- Update checks hit PyPI JSON only
- Opt-out available: `export FAIRY_NO_UPDATE=1`
- No data uploads or external API calls during validation

### Transparency
- Complete SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Third-party dependency audit trail
- Open source with clear licensing

## Deployment Options

### Docker (Recommended for shared nodes)
```bash

  fairy validate /data/example-geo -o /data/out
```

### Conda/Mamba
```bash
mamba create -n fairy -y python=3.11 && mamba activate fairy
pip install fairy-validator==0.1.0
